## Program Profiles
- This folder contains all "profiles" and "meta-profiles" that appman use
- To add a new "profile/meta-profile", simply add the source file in this folder

### How create a profile
- Each profile would be contained in a file named "[Program Name].py"
- To learn how create a profile, follow the model into "\_example_profile.py" or look an already implemented profile

### How create a meta-profile
- Each meta-profile would be contained in a file named "[Meta Name].py"
- To learn how create a profile, follow the model into "\_example_meta.py" or look an already an implemented meta-profile

### General Rules
- NOT touch any file that begin with underscore (except "\_example_profile.py" and "\_example_meta.py", that are never invoked)
- Each profile/meta-profile MUST have a different name (consider that the program name is case insensitive)
